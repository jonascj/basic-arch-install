basicarchinstall
================

Basic installation of Arch Linux as shell script. 
It is more or less just the commands from 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide 
written into a few shell scripts.

install.sh executes inside-arch-chroot.sh and outside-arch-chroot.sh
inside and outside chroot respectively.
